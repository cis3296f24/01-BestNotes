# Best Notes
BestNotes is a Python recreation of the app/program GoodNotes, a note-taking application. 
The user gets to create a digital notebook 
where they can write down notes for class or personal uses like journaling.
Through either drawing by their mouse or a stylus, users can create drawings as well as hand-written notes 
that they can easily move around by using a select tool. The program will also have a text feature, 
that allows the user to type their notes, which is easily moveable through the select tool. 
The notebooks have an autosave feature that saves these notebooks to the userâ€™s devices. 
This program also has a collaboration feature that allows users to work together on a notebook.
